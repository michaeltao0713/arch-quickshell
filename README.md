# arch-quickshell

Basically completely ripped off of [Caelestia Shell](https://github.com/caelestia-dots/shell)

## Setup:

Create empty text file: `.qmlls.ini` under `quickshell/`.

Create `exec-once` rule in `hyprland.conf`.

Currently relying on `pywal` for colors and `swww` for setting/changing wallpapers.

<!-- Need to install `ddcutil`, `brightnessctl` for monitor detection and brightness control respectively. -->
