# arch-quickshell

Basically completely ripped off of [Caelestia Shell](https://github.com/caelestia-dots/shell)

## Setup:

Create empty text file: `.qmlls.ini` under `quickshell/`.

Create `exec-once` rule in `hyprland.conf`.

Currently relying on `pywal` for colors and `swww` for setting/changing wallpapers.

Fonts needed: `ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols`, `ttf-cascadia-code-nerd`, `ttf-fira-code` <-- Set in the settings for vscode too (fira code only)

<!-- Need to install `ddcutil`, `brightnessctl` for monitor detection and brightness control respectively. -->
